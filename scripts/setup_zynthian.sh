# ZYNTHIAN PROJECT: Zynthian Standalone Setup Script
# 
# Setup zynthian from scratch in a completely fresh minibian-jessie image.
# No need for nothing else. Only run the script twice, following the next
# instructions:
#
# 1. Run first time: sh ./setup_zynthian.sh
# 2. Reboot: It should reboot automaticly after step 1
# 3. Run second time: screen -t setup -L sh ./setup_zynthian.sh
# 4. Take a good beer, sit down and relax ... ;-)
